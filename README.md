# First contact

Some people can't just get the Vanilla guide from /r/Hackintosh working just right. Reasons can differ: can't set up the VM for whatever reason, can't access a real mac \(although this guide works on macOS too\), download corruptions, small USB disks \(at this time and age? shame on you\), 4GB of RAM \(seriously?\)... or just pure laziness.

It happens that real macs can re-install macOS directly from the internet, without the need for a disk or installer support, and they do that through "Internet Recovery". When a mac finds no OS or recovery partition, it will try to load a recovery system from Apple's servers and then boot it then install macOS through the internet to the mac. And following the same idea, we can, as hackintoshers, do the same \(sort of\). Btw, did I tell you this guide will work on any OS?

If you're here from gitbook, I'm moving this guide to Github Pages, use this [**LINK**](https://midi1996.github.io/hackintosh-internet-install-gitbook/) for the new layout (has dark theme, so you know it's 10/10). 

#### How does it work?

So this procedure goes mainly like this:

1. Create a USB drive with two partitions: one to hold the macOS "recovery system" and one to hold the Clover EFI files
2. Download macOS recovery system using [gibMacOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS)
3. Copy the macOS recovery system to the USB using Disk Utility's "restore" 
4. Copy Clover files to the USB 
5. Configure Clover with the proper config, Kexts and UEFI Drivers
6. Insert the USB drive into the target computer, reboot into the boot menu and set certain BIOS options
7. Allow the macOS Recovery disk to boot
8. Format the target hard drive
9. Install macOS onto the target hard drive
10. After the installation completes, follow the post-install steps from [Vanilla Guide](https://hackintosh.gitbook.io/-r-hackintosh-vanilla-desktop-guide/)
11. BOOM! We're done.

#### What will this guide cover?

* Requirements
* macOS recovery downloading
* USB device partitioning and macOS recovery image restoring
* Clover configuration
  * Kexts
  * UEFI drivers
  * config.plist \(configuration file\)
    * For laptops
    * For desktops
* Firmware/BIOS general settings advice
* Booting and Installing macOS

This guide will \***probably**\* not contain any post-install guide, as it's documented on the [Vanilla Guide](https://hackintosh.gitbook.io/-r-hackintosh-vanilla-desktop-guide/). This guide is for Pre-install preparation and Install, you will need to go to the Vanilla Guide to finish the rest for Desktop users, and for laptop users you'll have to continue [here](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-booting-the-os-x-installer-on-laptops-with-clover.148093/#post-917904). This will be brought up at the end of this guide.

## Before you even start:

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is not a very welcoming community for people who do not want to do some self-study and learn from other's findings and instead wait for someone to spoon-feed them information and make things work for them. Read The Fucking Manual and work your way through it and do some intense googling.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**READ THE GUIDE FULLY TWICE BEFORE ASKING.** Most probably your question has already been answered, and if not, someone did ask it and it's on the net somewhere.
